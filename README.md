# Computational Intelligence Coursework and Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains all the coursework, projects, and study materials related to the Computational Intelligence course. The course explores biologically inspired algorithms, including evolutionary algorithms, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, and reinforcement learning. It also covers software tools and techniques for creating visualizations of these algorithms in action.

## Course Contents
- **Evolutionary Algorithms**: Concepts, implementations, and applications.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Theory, coding exercises, and real-world problem-solving examples.
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Fundamentals, algorithmic structure, and usage scenarios.
- **Self Organizing Maps (SOM)**: Concept and implementation of self organizing maps based on certain properties.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Introduction, strategies, and advanced topics.
- **Visualization Tools**: Software and libraries used to visualize the algorithms' performance and behavior.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Explore Course Materials**: Navigate through the folders to find study materials, lecture notes, and resources for each topic covered in the course.
2. **Running Projects**: Each project folder contains a README with instructions on how to set up and run the projects. Ensure you have the required software and dependencies installed.
